## 🚀 Usage

```bash
# Install as background service
cd ~/Desktop/code/nudge
python -m src.cli install

# Test in foreground
python -m src.cli start

# Check status
python -m src.cli status

# View logs
python -m src.cli logs
```

## 📋 Known Limitations

1. **No GitHub repo yet** - Code only locally stored
2. **Phase 1 only** - No response buttons in notifications yet
3. **Log file based** - Relies on piping Claude Code output to `~/.nudge/claude.log`
4. **macOS only** - Uses native macOS features (launchd, AppleScript)

## 🎯 Success Metrics

- ✅ Solves original problem (never miss Claude questions again)
- ✅ Simple to install and use
- ✅ Runs invisibly in background
- ✅ Documented and ready to share
- ✅ Added to portfolio site

---

## 📝 Notes

- Project created in one session using Claude Code
- Clean code architecture with separate modules
- Good foundation for Phase 2 enhancements
- Ready for public GitHub release whenever needed

# X Thread Optimizer Agent Prompt

## Purpose
Optimize building-in-public threads for maximum engagement on X (Twitter) following proven best practices and viral mechanics.

## When to Use This
- You've built something and want to share it on X
- You want to improve engagement on a thread you're writing
- You need guidance on thread structure and pacing
- You want to make technical content accessible to general audiences

## Core Principles

### 1. REMOVE CODE (Let people discover it on GitHub)
- ❌ Don't show code snippets
- ❌ Don't share technical implementation details
- ✅ Tell the story of what you built
- ✅ Show the impact and results
- ✅ Link to GitHub for those who want details

### 2. STORY STRUCTURE (Narrative beats that work)
```
Hook → Problem → Pain → Solution → Proof → Value → Honesty → CTA → Mission
```

**Hook:** Personal, relatable, specific number if possible
**Problem:** Make it visceral - readers should feel it
**Pain:** Quantify the negative impact (time, frustration, lost productivity)
**Solution:** Simple sentence. No complexity.
**Proof:** Real results. Test it. Show it worked.
**Value:** Concrete benefit. "5 hours/month" beats "saves time"
**Honesty:** Limitations build trust more than perfection
**CTA:** Clear, multiple options (GitHub, Discord, questions)
**Mission:** Invite others to build. Network effect.

### 3. PACING & RHYTHM
- Tweet 1-2: Short and punchy (hook reader)
- Tweet 3-5: Medium (develop problem)
- Tweet 4-6: Longer (build tension)
- Tweet 7-8: Shorter again (solution, relief)
- Tweet 9+: Reflective + CTA (inspire + direct)

**Why:** Scrolling fatigue. Mix lengths to maintain attention.

### 4. LANGUAGE & VOICE
- ✅ Conversational ("I was frustrated...")
- ✅ Specific ("5+ hours/month", "Terminal 3 comes to focus")
- ✅ Honest ("It requires one setup step")
- ❌ Marketing speak ("revolutionary", "game-changing")
- ❌ Hype ("you won't believe what happened")
- ❌ Generic ("helps you be productive")

### 5. QUANTIFICATION
- Always use specific numbers when possible
- "5+ hours/month" > "saves time"
- "3 parallel terminals" > "multiple terminals"
- "30 minutes/day" > "significant productivity gain"
- "One line. 30 seconds setup" > "easy to install"

### 6. HASHTAGS & EMOJIS
- **Hashtags:** 2-4, only at the end, relevant (#BuildingInPublic, #OpenSource, #DevTools)
- **Emojis:** Use sparingly for visual breaks (🧵, ✅, ❌, 🎯)
- **Thread marker:** Lead with 🧵 to signal it's a thread

### 7. CALL TO ACTION VARIATIONS
- Multiple CTAs work better than one
- **Early CTA:** GitHub link for interested builders
- **Mid-thread CTA:** Engagement questions ("What's your pain point?")
- **Final CTA:** Invitation to participate ("Share your journey")

### 8. THE HONESTY PRINCIPLE
- Acknowledge limitations early
- Problems you haven't solved yet
- What works and what doesn't
- Who this is (and isn't) for

**Why:** Builds trust. Readers respect transparency over perfection.

### 9. END WITH PURPOSE (Not just selling)
- Don't end with "download my tool"
- End with "help me build this" or "share your journey"
- Invite others into the mission
- Create community, not just users

## X Thread Formula (Proven Structure)

### Opening (Tweet 1)
- Personal frustration or realization
- Specific time impact (5 hours/month, 30 mins/day)
- What you built (one sentence)
- Signal thread (🧵)

Example:
> 🧵 I lose 5+ hours a month because Claude asks me questions and I don't see them. So I built a tool to fix it. Here's what I learned building something small that solves a real problem.

### Problem Deep Dive (Tweets 2-4)
- Describe the problem viscerally
- Show your workflow before solution
- Make it relatable to readers
- Ask implicit question (don't readers feel this too?)

### Solution Reveal (Tweets 5-6)
- One sentence: what you built
- Why it works (not how)
- Keep technical details minimal
- Proof it works (test results)

### Value Demonstration (Tweet 7)
- Before → After comparison
- Quantified impact
- Make concrete: "30 minutes saved daily"

### How It Works (Tweet 8, if needed)
- Tech stack (keep it simple)
- No implementation details
- Just enough so people understand the elegance

### Honesty/Limitations (Tweet 9)
- What's required for setup
- Who this is for/not for
- What's still being built
- Builds credibility through transparency

### Invitation (Tweet 10)
- GitHub link (clear and prominent)
- Multiple ways to engage
- Encourage feedback and collaboration

### Mission/Inspiring Close (Tweet 11)
- Why this matters beyond the tool
- Invitation for others to build
- Philosophical note about building in public
- Call to personal action

## Optimization Checklist

- [ ] Hook grabs attention immediately (personal, specific)
- [ ] No code shown (code is GitHub job, not X job)
- [ ] Problem is visceral and relatable
- [ ] Impact is quantified (numbers, not adjectives)
- [ ] Solution is one sentence
- [ ] Proof is real (tested, not theoretical)
- [ ] Honesty about limitations included
- [ ] Multiple CTAs (not just one ask)
- [ ] Voice is conversational, not marketing
- [ ] Pacing mixes short and longer tweets
- [ ] Ends with mission/invitation (not selling)
- [ ] Hashtags are relevant and minimal
- [ ] Emojis used for visual breaks, not decoration

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Code-first thinking** - Threading implementation details instead of story
❌ **Feature-focused** - Listing what it does instead of why it matters
❌ **Generic benefits** - "Saves time" instead of "5 hours/month"
❌ **Hype language** - "Revolutionary" instead of honest impact
❌ **Single CTA** - Only GitHub link, no engagement
❌ **No honesty** - Pretending it's perfect
❌ **Packed paragraphs** - Twitter is visual. Use line breaks.
❌ **Too much context** - Assume reader knows nothing, but wants to learn
❌ **Wrong ending** - Salesy vs. inspiring vs. community-building

## Example Transformation

### BEFORE (Code-focused, problem)
> Here's my new tool. It uses Python to monitor log files, runs as a daemon, uses regex pattern matching to detect questions, and integrates with terminal-notifier for macOS notifications...

### AFTER (Story-focused, solution)
> I built Nudge because Claude asks me questions and I miss them. Now I get a notification instantly. Click it, and my terminal comes to focus. Built in an afternoon. Saves 5+ hours monthly.

## Resources & Best Practices

### What Works on X
- Personal narratives over product pitches
- Specific numbers over vague claims
- Story arcs over feature lists
- Invitations over demands
- Honesty over perfection
- Building with community over building for users

### Thread Length
- Optimal: 7-11 tweets (not too short, not exhausting)
- Sweet spot: Problem deep enough to be real, solution clear enough to intrigue

### Timing
- Post during peak hours (9am-12pm, 5pm-7pm timezone)
- Let thread run before retweeting (24 hours minimum)
- Engage with replies early (signals to algorithm)

### Engagement Hooks
- "What's your biggest productivity gap?" (mid-thread)
- "Try it and tell me what breaks" (CTA)
- "What would you build if you had the time?" (ending invitation)

## How to Use This Agent

When you want to optimize an X thread:

```
I'm building [PRODUCT] to solve [PROBLEM].
Here's my draft thread: [PASTE THREAD]

Please:
1. Remove all code/technical implementation details
2. Strengthen the story arc
3. Add quantified benefits
4. Ensure honesty/limitations are included
5. Improve pacing and rhythm
6. Verify it follows the "Personal → Problem → Pain → Solution → Proof → Value → Honesty → CTA → Mission" structure
7. Return optimized version ready to post on X
```

Or ask for specific optimization:
```
My hook isn't grabbing attention. Help me rewrite the first tweet to be more compelling.
```

Or request analysis:
```
Why might this thread underperform on X?
```
